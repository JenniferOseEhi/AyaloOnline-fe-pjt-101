ABOUT AYALO ONLINE
On the one hand, many people have projects to work on but they do not have the right equipment to use. This can be caused by a lot of factors which include equipment cost and availability.
On the other hand, some individuals or organizations have these equipment others need and they may not be utilized frequently, or the individual or organization will like to specialize in renting out equipment.
There’s a disconnect here. Some people want to rent, another set wants to rent out their equipment. This brings the need for a bridge. Àyálo Online is that bridge. The platform bridges the gap between those that want to rent equipment and those that want to rent out their equipment. No individual has to worry about getting the right equipment to carry out a project, whether it's a big road construction concern or as small as a Media project. From concept to market the platform will give you the space to execute as though you had a full efficient space, studio, workshop etc. Organizations and individuals can easily rent out their equipment at a cost that is favorable to everyone
This website is targeted at a broad range of industries from manufacturers to restaurants, Business owners (Lessee)who connect and make payments to Equipment Leasing Companies (Lessor) and in return are granted access to machinery, tools, or equipment that they don’t yet own.
Some of the equipment a small scale business owners might want to borrow includes; Multimedia Equipment, Catering Equipment, Sound Equipment, Events Equipmets like Chairs, Canopy etc.,  .
Additionally, Equipment Leasing Company (The Lessor) are owners of various equipment they require an agreement of terms and conditions between the lessor and the lessee. The rental period begins from the day when the equipment is shipped or picked-up from the lessor and ends on the day when the equipment is returned, this is the platform Ayalo online provides.
